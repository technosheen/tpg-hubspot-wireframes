3️⃣ The Problem: The Hidden Leaks in Pipeline
The False Sense of Security
Your CRM shows a “healthy” pipeline—but half of opportunities have no next step
documented. Only 16% of sales activity ever makes it into the CRM. Nearly 50% of leads have
no disposition or owner. Sales reps make four attempts on a lead, but it now takes 26 to reach a
buyer.
The pipeline looks fine on paper, but it’s leaking everywhere.
Support visually with a simple illustration of a funnel with gaps or leaks.

The headaches we eliminate

These are the issues that drive CROs, CMOs, and PE operating partners crazy—and they all stem

Design &amp; Tone Notes
 Minimalist visual style: lots of white space, thin dividing lines, elegant typography—like
Ramp.
 Strong verbs: gain, spot, steer, deliver.
 Short, scannable copy: 1–2 sentences per section; bullets for clarity.
 Evidence everywhere: key metrics and client names woven into the layout.
